<h4>Unlike Astro, on Gatspy the App's hierarchy is pretty structured and the available template is nice looking, and the last thing is Gatspy is so compatible with the CMS i'm using.</h4>

**Note:** This starter uses [Gatsby v4](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/gatsby-4/).

This repo contains an example business website that is built with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), and [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org): **[Demo Link](https://gatsby-netlify-cms.netlify.com/)**.

It follows the [JAMstack architecture](https://jamstack.org) by using Git as a single source of truth, and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) for continuous deployment, and CDN distribution.
